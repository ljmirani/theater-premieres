 # Project Two: Theater Premieres

For the second Project of the Lede Program 2024 I wanted to make a guide to the new plays of some of my favorite theaters in Munich and Berlin. Honestly this project failed - but 
I also learned quite a few things (so not a total fail). My mistakes were bad time-management (to be fair, that wad due to an unexpectly big workload in my job), overcomplicating things and wanting to do more than I could at this point. So it became a fraction of what it was supposed to be, but that is okay and onto the next.

## Data

* [This](https://github.com/ljmirani/theater-premieres/blob/main/Scrape_Gorki.ipynb) Notebook has the code I used to scrape the data of the Gorki Theater with Beautiful Soup
* [This](https://github.com/ljmirani/theater-premieres/blob/main/Scrape_Schaub%C3%BChne_soup.ipynb) Notebook has the code I used to scrape the data of the Schaub√ºhne with Beautiful Soup
* [This](https://github.com/ljmirani/theater-premieres/blob/main/Scrape_Kammerspiele_lxml.ipynb) Notebook has the code I used to scrape the data of the Kammerspiele with lxml, to try something different

## Website
[This]( https://ljmirani.github.io/theater-premieres/) is the website that I created for this project.

## What I learned
* The Basics of Scraping
* Using new data cleaning tricks, we learned in class

## What I would have liked to do (with more time/skills)
* so many things
